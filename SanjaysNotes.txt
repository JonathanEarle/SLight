Notes for Sanjay

There are unused functions in the document, such as addVehicle. Remove them.

The concept of maxVehicles should not exist, Arrays are dynamic, look at python list documentation.

You are not utilizing python fully, you hard coded in the number of sensors and LEDs when you couldve taken the length of the array which held them.

Comment all of the functions even the simple ones a little

The two global variables are not necessary can declare them in main and then pass them into the function.

The range you hard coded in as 3 should be calculated based on the time taken to pass between the sensors, this calculation is a function.

There are various runtime errors which occur, fix them.

Turn the logic used to have the lights come on into a function which can be called and completed in a few lines in main, just as the light on/off function was easy to use and just did its job.

Edit is so it works for multiple sensors, note with more than two sensors one trigger can be a start and another an end, work around this. A system that is easy to use with any number of sensors is the goal.

These points are to ensure we have a high score with our code and if anything goes wrong the system is robust enough to handle it and not fall apart.
